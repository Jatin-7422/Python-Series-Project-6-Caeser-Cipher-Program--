# Caesar Cipher Python Program 

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Caesar cipher program developed in Python. This program showcases my implementation of the encryption and decryption techniques using the Caesar cipher method.

## Program Description

The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It offers a straightforward yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Getting Started

To use the program:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script to launch the program.
3. Follow the instructions to encrypt or decrypt your messages.

## Usage
- Firstly Type "encode" for Encryption and "decode" for decryption

- Encryption: Enter your plaintext message and the shift_key (number of positions to shift).
- Decryption: Enter the encrypted message and the same key used for encryption.

## Development

This Caesar cipher program is my own implementation in Python. Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or enhancements, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Feedback

Your feedback is highly appreciated. If you have any comments or questions about the program, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for exploring the Caesar Cipher Python Program!
